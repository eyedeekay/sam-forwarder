    <p>
      Forward a local port to i2p over the SAM API, or proxy a destination to a port
      on the local host. This is no longer substantially a work-in-progress, it&#39;s a
      very useful way of configuring applications in an i2ptunnel-like way. TCP and
      UDP are supported, but there may be some lingering bugs in UDP, please report
      them if found.

      The standalone application for configuring tunnels is named samcatd and it&#39;s
      main package is in the directory
      <code>
        ./samcatd
      </code>
      . It works as a cli and is
      capable of running a WebUI, which is currently view-only. In a future time, the
      WebUI will also be capable of configuring and editing tunnels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous application ephsite has been fully retired. If you were using it,
      it can usually be replaced with
      <code>
        samcatd -s
      </code>
      and your existing arguments.

      Current limitations:
    </h1>
    <p>
      I need samcatd to accept a configuration folder identical to
      /etc/i2pd/tunnels.conf.d, since part of the point of this is to be compatible
      with i2pd&#39;s tunnels configuration. Once this is done, I&#39;ll resume turning it
      into a .deb package.
    </p>
    <p>
      It doesn&#39;t encrypt the .i2pkeys file by default, so if someone can steal them,
      then they can use them to construct tunnels to impersonate you. Experimental
      support for encrypted saves has been added. The idea is that only the person
      with the key will be able to decrypt and start the tunnels. It is up to the user
      to determine how to go about managing these keys. Right now this system is
      pretty bad. I&#39;ll be addressing that soon too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experimental support for KCP-based error correction and streaming-over-datagrams
      is in the works. Some kind of reverse-proxy or filter is also an obvious choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve only enabled the use of a subset of the i2cp and tunnel configuration
      options, the ones I use the most and for no other real reason assume other
      people use the most. They&#39;re pretty easy to add, it&#39;s just boring.
      <em>
        If you
      </em>
      <em>
        want an i2cp or tunnel option that isn&#39;t available, bring it to my attention
      </em>
      <em>
        please.
      </em>
      I&#39;m pretty responsive when people actually contact me, it&#39;ll probably
      be added within 24 hours. I intend to have configuration options for all
      relevant i2cp and tunnel options, which I&#39;m keeping track of
      <a href="config/CHECKLIST.md" rel="nofollow">
        here
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      I need to just change how the configuration is done entirely. I want it to work
      with the configuration formats used by each I2P router.
    </p>
    <p>
      TLS configuration is experimental. I have decided to implement optional,
      automatically-configured self-signed TLS certificates. No CA support is planned
      as an alternative CA would have to be used and no apparent option exists which
      would be usable. If you&#39;re working on anything like that, I would like very
      to know.
